Since august 2025, I'm a cybersecurity engineer. I started to study computer science since 5 years in high school with the fundamentals concepts of how a network and software development works. During this three years of high school, I have worked on a project which had mix development and network in order to involve on this concepts. 

After my high school years, I had the opportunity to go in a graduate courses to be an engineer with a focus in cybersecurity. For me, it was an obvious choice because cybersecurity is very important nowadays according to the increase of devices in the world and the attacks methods. In the engineering program, I saw software/application development in details, the fundamentals of DevOps like Git CI/CD or Kubernetes Clusters, how a network can be securise and the **most important** for me is how a **penetration test** is performed, its steps and some of the required knowledges/skills.

I'm always keen to learn, so in my spare time I do CTF (Capture The Flag) testing to develop my penetration testing skills, knowledges and **offensive security** aspects. When I'm available, I write articles as you can see in the post section to explain my thinking and share it to other people. This allows me to discover new software, tools and many known attacks in the world of cybersecurity. I use the websites present in my Useful tool post to train myself!
